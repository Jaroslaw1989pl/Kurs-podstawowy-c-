Familiarize the student with:

    working with multiple strings to combine into a single result.

Scenario

A common action when editing text is to replace an expression or word with yet another expression.

Write a program that will read three lines of text. In the last line read replace all occurrences of the expression in the first line with the expression in the second line.

Make sure that changing an expression to a similar expression will not cause your program any problems.
