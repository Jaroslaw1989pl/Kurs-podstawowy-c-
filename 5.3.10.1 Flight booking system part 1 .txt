
Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    modelling real-world entities with classes and objects.

Scenario

Now that you're a little more familiar with classes and objects, let's pretend we're working on an airline flight booking system.

Our systems save an identification number, the capacity and the number of seats reserved for all flight bookings.

Our first job will be to print out a status report about the percentage of capacity filled.

The report should be in the form: "Flight [id] : [reserved]/[capacity] ([percentage]%) seats taken"

For now, let's not limit the number of reserved seats. We'll work on that later.

Example input
100 50

Example output
Flight 1 : 50/100 (50%) seats reserved

Example input
180 200

Example output
Flight 1 : 200/180 (111%) seats reserved
