Scenario

Have you ever wondered how to find a weekday for any (past or future) date? Okay, you can check it in a calendar (you probably have one on your smartphone), but this is no solution for a coder. We do it the harder and more exciting way – we're going to write a program for it (did you ever suspect we were going to offer you anything else?)

One of the most popular algorithms for this task is the so-called "Zeller's congruence". Sounds complicated? Nothing could be further from the truth, and we're going to show you exactly that. You'll need three values:

    year number (int – let's assume that we're interested only in dates from the 20th and 21st centuries);
    month number (int – 1 to 12);
    day number (int – 1 to it depends)

Be patient – this will take a while:

    Decrease month number by 2;
    if month number becomes less than 0, increment it by 12 and decrement year by 1;
    take month number and multiply it by 83 and divide it by 32;
    add day number to month;
    add year number to month;
    add year/4 to month;
    subtract year/100 from month;
    add year/400 to month;
    find the remainder of dividing month by 7;
    Congrats! A weekday number is ready for you! 0 – Sunday, 1 – Monday, ... and so on.

We want you to write a code which finds a weekday number for a date entered by a user. The program should ask the user for the year, month and day (in this order) and output a value indicating a weekday.

Make your code as smart as possible.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
