
Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    C++ class and object syntax;
    creating objects;
    accessing object members.

Scenario

Before we start doing anything useful with classes, objects and the like, we should familiarize ourselves a little with these concepts.

So for now, let's represent a person in terms of classes!

Run the code below and then experiment with it. Add some more members to the class and try accessing them.
===================================================================================================

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Person
{
public:
  string name;
  int    age;
  // Your code here
  string surname;
  string sex;
  
};
void print(Person* os)
{
  if(os->sex=="male")
  cout << "He's name is "<< os->name << " and he is " << os->age << " years old" << endl;
  else
  cout << "She's name is "<< os->name << " and she is " << os->age << " years old" << endl;
}

int main()
{
  Person person;
  person.name = "Harry";
  person.age  = 23;
  person.surname  = "Dirt";
  person.sex  = "male";

  cout << "Meet " << person.name <<" "<< person.surname << endl;
  print(&person);

  // Your code here
  Person p2;
  p2.name="Joanna";
  p2.surname="Dzik";
  p2.age=30;
  p2.sex="female";

  cout << "Meet " << p2.name <<" "<< p2.surname << endl;
  print(&p2);

  return 0;
