
Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    identifying situations when exceptions are thrown;
    adding code to handle exceptions.

Scenario

Insert a try-catch block into this program to solve potential problems with arithmetic operations. Remember to inform the user of any exceptions in simple words.

Example input
4 2

Example output
2

Example input
4 0

Example output
Your input is not valid, you can't divide by zero.
