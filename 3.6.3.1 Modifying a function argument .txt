
Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    the concept of passing arguments by reference;
    using a function in order to modify its arguments.

Scenario

We need a very specific function and we need it ASAP. This is how we imagine it:

    its name is "increment";
    it returns void;
    when invoked with one argument (an int variable), it simply increments the variable by 1;
    when invoked with two arguments (an int variable and int expression), it increments the variable by the expression's value.

Sorry, we cannot show you the function's header – it would be too easy. We'll only show you how we invoke the function – the rest is up to you.

Complete the code below.

Run your code and check whether your output is the same as ours.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Insert your function here
void increment(int &var, int expr=1)
{
    var+=expr;
}
int main(void) {
	int var = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		if(i % 2)
			increment(var);
		else
			increment(var,i);
	cout << var << endl;
	return 0;
