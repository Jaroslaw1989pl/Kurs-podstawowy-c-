Scenario

We're almost sure that you've heard of the Fibonacci sequence. It's a series of natural numbers built up by a simple formula:

    the first Fibonacci number is equal to 1;
    the second Fibonacci number is equal to 1 too;
    the third, fourth and every subsequent Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.

This means that the first five Fibonacci numbers look as follows:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5

Is that clear? Of course it is! Now it's your turn – write a code asking the user for a number (let's name it n) and then print an n-th Fibonacci number.

But beware! These numbers grow very fast – use proper data types to avoid premature overflows!

Test your code using the data we've provided.
