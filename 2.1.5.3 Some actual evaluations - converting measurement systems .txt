Scenario

Among the many measurement systems available, two seem to be the most widespread: metric and imperial. To make things simpler, we assume that the first one uses the "meter" as its only unit (expressed as a real number), while the second uses the "foot" (always an integer) and the "inch" (a real number).

Your task is to write a simple "measurement converter". We want it to perform the following actions:

    ask the user which system she/he uses to input data; we assume that 0 means "metric" and 1 means "imperial";
    depending on the user's answer, ask either for meters or feet and inches;
    output the distance in proper (different) units: either in feet and inches or in meters;
    a result outputted as metric should look like 123.4m;
    a result outputted as imperial should look like 12'3.5".

Look at the code below – it's only a template. Use it to implement the whole converter.

Make your code smart – it shouldn't be fooled by stupid or unreasonable inputs.

Test your code using the data we've provided.

Example input
0 1

Example output
3'3.37008"

Example input
1 3 3.37008

Example output
1m

Example input
0 0.0254

Example output
0'1"

Example input
1 0 1

Example output
0.0254m
