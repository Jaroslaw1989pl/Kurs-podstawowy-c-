
Objectives

Improve the student's skills in:

    using "passing by reference" mechanisms;
    and familiarize the student with the concepts of overloading function.

Scenario

Sorry for bothering you, but we have to tell you that the function you implemented last time needs to be supplemented with another one that performs (more or less) the same actions, but uses different type of data. We can't say anything more, but we're sure that you'll be able to deduce all our intentions and needs from the code below.

Complete the code and run it to check whether your output is the same as ours.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

// Insert your functions here
void increment(int &var, int expr=1)
{
    var+=expr;
}
void increment(float &var, int expr=1)
{
    var+=expr;
}

int main(void) {

	int intvar = 0;
	float floatvar = 1.5;

	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		if(i % 2) {
			increment(intvar);
			increment(floatvar, sqrt(intvar));
		}
		else {
			increment(intvar,i);
			increment(floatvar);
		}
	cout << intvar * floatvar << endl;
	return 0;
